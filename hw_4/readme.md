#Week 4:Creating a Drawing Using p5.js

  This week I learned how to use shapes, colors, and other commands such as `push()` and `pop()` in Atom to create a drawing. This was all done with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/). To start my drawing I had to first, create a canvas using the knowledge I had gained the week before. Then I used the `function draw()` command to start my drawing. I had to use `push()` and `pop()` to create these sandboxes to keep all of my shapes for the drawing separate. This helped me add layers to the drawing to better understand what I wanted to do next. One problem I had was using the `translate()` command. I didn't use it properly and it messed my entire grid up. But in the end I created my first drawing using code. I drew Frankenstein's Monster. I have attached that above.
